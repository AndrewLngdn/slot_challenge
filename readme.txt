A minimalist 3D slotmachine created in 2 hours for a coding challenge. All code in first commit was written in about two hours, any changes after the commit were made after time was up. 

I may come back and clean up some of the code as it is non-ideal due to time constraints. I want to make the SlotMachine code a little more modular, and pull in some of the static CSS that should really be calculated in JS. That way you could actually play with the class's settings without breaking anything.
I'd also like to find better images and clean them up a little bit.
